		<h2>Quick Control Panel</h2>
		<p>The Quick Control Panel can be opened by clicking on the AlphaText icon on the browser bar. The Quick Control Panel is where you can apply appearance changes to your current webpage and control whether to save the current website to always automatically use AlphaText when launched.</p>
		<p>To quickly apply style changes, choose from the dropdown menus under the Quick Styles section the attributes you would like to apply. If you do not wish to change some of the attributes, leave them as "---". Then, click on the "Set" button. You should see the styles being applied to the webpage!</p>
		<p>You can also apply a set, or "Profile", of appearance styles at once, by clicking on the saved profiles. You can set your profiles in the options page.</p>
		<p>If you wish to remove the appearance changes applied at any point, click on the "Remove all styles" button.</p>
		<p>You are also able to always apply a profile to certain saved websites once you launch AlphaText. To save a website domain, apply the profile you would like the website domain to always adopt, and then click on the "Always use profile on domain" button. At any point, you can also remove the saved domain by clicking "Don't use on domain" when on the website domain.</p>

		<h2>Options</h2>
		<p>The options page is where you can define and manage your style profiles, as well as check which domains you have saved to always use an AlphaText profile.</p>
		<p>To define a new profile, set the appearance attributes, and click "Add as Profile". You can only save a maximum of 3 profiles. Delete any profile by clicking on the <img title='Delete' src='images/delete_n_b.png' class="delbutton" alt="del" width="20px" height="20px"/> next to the profile.</p>
		<p>Under "Saved Domains Management", you can see a list of the domains you have saved, as well as the profiles associated with them. Click on the domain link to go to the website. Delete the saved entry by clicking on the delete button <img title='Delete' src='images/delete_n_b.png' class="delbutton" alt="del" width="20px" height="20px"/>.</p>
